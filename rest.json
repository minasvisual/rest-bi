Formed in 2010 by Nicholas Wood and Kat Day, the KVB got started with a number of limited cassette and vinyl releases before their first full-length, Always Then, arrived in 2012. Two more albums, Immaterial Visions and Minus One, arrived the following year, Minus One being a proper release of material that had surfaced before in the form of digital downloads and extremely limited cassettes. In 2014, the duo ventured to Brian Jonestown Massacre mastermind Anton Newcombe's Berlin studio to track what would become their Out of Body EP, released later that year on Newcombe's own A Records label. This session would mark the KVB's first recordings made outside of their own home studio as well as the first time they'd work with drummer Joe Dilworth, best known for his work with Stereolab. Keeping up their busy schedule, the KVB collected some of the more experimental output they recorded in 2014 on Mirror Being, which Invada released in June of the following year. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+KVB\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The gloomy voices express feelings from the human being, not only about love but also about lonelyness on account of this individualist world, always in a very clear way, followed by pulsating and tense beats. Besides, the agressive bass aggravates all the sadness or happyness felt on an alienating, doubted or broken relationship, lead by gentle guitars, both \"bathed\" in effects and feelings as well as the keyboards'arrangement, so to speak. Formed at the beginning of 2005 by Tiago Abud (bass), Daniel Abud (vocal/guitar), João Artur (guitar) and Airton Silva (drums), the band faced diferents formations due to the sucessive changes of keyboard player and guitar player because of personal problems and the fact that their ideas always cotrasted with the ones of the other members. That's why today The Knutz remain with the same musicians of the beginning, however with the addiction of Zero (keyboards/backing vocal) and without João Artur (guitar) in the group. In the end of 2006, Knutz recorded, mixed and mastered their first album with 15 songs at 1009 STUDIO in Niterói / RJ- Brazil and registered on UFRJ. With this DEMO CD, the band started to get known on the Brazilian Gothic scene, always searching for new bands with similar styles and ideas so that they can make progress and grow together. Currently, take part in independent projects as Substance Records, Black Future Tribute and WoodGothic Festival. Produced by Astronauta Discos, are supposed to record the official album in 2008. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Knutz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "There are more than one artist with this name:\n\n1) AM is an indie rock band formed in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Silverlake, California . New Album Future Sons & Daughters was produced by Charles Newman (Magnetic Fields). The band consists of founding member AM (vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar),  Michael Sawtizke (electric guitar), Mark Getten (bass), Jesse Nason and Brett Bixby (piano, organ, synths), Chris Lovejoy (percussion)  and Derek Brown (drums- The Eels/ Everest). \n\nAbout AM:\n\n The lead singer and founder is \"AM\" whose moniker is derived from his initials. Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana he brings twanging Americana, twinkling folk-rock-pop, caressing Philly soul, and funky R&B whatchacallit to the band's sound. He has drawn influences from various artists including the Beatles, Badfinger, Curtis Mayfield and Jorge Ben, and demonstrates over and again the simple fact of songwriting life: that imagination and taste is what it's all about. AM was handpicked by French duo Air to open their U.S., Canadian, and French tour and also toured with Charlotte Gainsbourg in North America in 2010. They have been compared to Wilco,  Beck, and Last Shadow Puppets,\n\n“…AM writes literate, emotionally balanced tunes that are infectious without being moronic, hip without being oh so, and pop infected without losing their edge… he is a songwriter ready to be discovered by a wider audience, an audience interested in smart and sincere songs that speak to the vastness of the human spirit.”  \n\nFuture Sons & Daughters\n4**** Q Magazine UK\n5**** Sunday Express UK\nThe new album Future Sons & Daughters is a heady brew of twinkling Anglified folk-rock-pop with arguably, some of the best bridges and choruses in the bizness, that showcases AM's acute finessing ear for the ancient art of real, true songcraft. The album was produced by Charles Newman (responsible for the sounds of The Magnetic Field and who simultaneously produced AM's record and The Magnetic Field's new album) and was recorded in both Elliot Smith's old house and Wilder Studios. \n\nThe latest music video is for the single \"Grand Opinion\" and was directed by Blake West and shot at the beaches of Zuma and Malibu, California. \n\nhttp://www.amsounds.com/\n\nTroubled Times\nAM's debut album \"Troubled Times\" had every song placed in a movie or television show which hasn't been done since Moby, and received a slew of other accolades including iTunes \"Best Indie Album Of The Year.\"\n\nSide By Side - Duets Vol. 1\nThis album features original tracks and two cover tunes performed with friends Meiko, Susie Suh, Julianna Raye, Buddy, Tina Dico and Rick Garcia. (5 Bonus tracks available at iTunes)  In earlier reviews, AM's music has been called \"mellow gold\" and \"Side By Side\" reinforces that. The EP is worth owning if only on the strength of two of the performances - the original \"A Part Of Something Missing\" performed with Rick Garcia and the incredibly haunting and beautiful cover of George Harrison's \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\" \"I'll Be Your Mirror\" is a Bossa Nova gem performed with Rufus Wainwright's Julianna Raye.  Gus Black (a singer/songwriter in his own right) directs AM's music video \"Hear Me Sing\" featuring Buddy.\n\nHoliday Happiness & Cheer EP \nAM delivers holiday music for the first time with his new EP “Holiday Happiness & Cheer”. Included is a beautifully haunting rendition of Vince Guaraldi’s “Christmas Time Is Here” (from the classic animated television Peanuts Special “A Charlie Brown Christmas”) complete with moody bossa influenced guitar, creepy synth work and McCartney style bass lines. Also included is an original song “I’m Home For The Holidays” – a spacious orchestral folk song that focuses on the somber elements of holiday time.\n\n\n2)  Sludge/doom metal from Finland, consisting of Mikko Aspa (Grunt, Clandestine Blaze...) and Jukka Mattila (Stumm, Throat).\n\n\n3) aM (ae’m)[アム(amu)] is a 2 person unit which creates Electro beats. Their music is influenced by many styles such as Techno, House, Funk, Rock, and Electro.\n\nFormed in Tokyo, Japan in 2001. The group consists of Hiroaki Kanai and Kōdai Tazawa.\n\nKōdai Tazawa was also the drummer for the band Supercar.\n\nHiroaki Kanai was a producer for the band Supercar.\n\nwww.26666.org\nwww.myspace.com/amofficial <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/AM\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was the first place we hit land after Northern Ireland.\" It was a fortuitous place to settle. Within a few months, they met bassist Graeme Hassall and began to rehearse. Living in \"a proper shit-hole\" (their flat, not the city), they started to make a name on Liverpools rich, rising scene. They were soon discovered by Alan Wills who signed them to his Deltasonic label. The Basement name came as a nod to Dylans Subterranean Homesick Blues because, as Mullin says, \"the place we were living and rehearsing in was like a basement and Mark used to take the piss out of me because of the line in the song that says Johnnys in The Basement. So it stuck.\"  In mid 2003, the band released Medicine Day. They followed this in 2004 with Do You Think Youre Movin On and then The Basement went away to work on the album.\n\nOn recording the album Mullin explains, \"I was never comfortable with the idea of walking into the studio with some guy youve never met and the clocks on and youve got to make magic. \"It was more about finding a situation that was comfortable for us. Producing the album was fellow Irish-man Mike Crossey at Liverpools Motor Museum Studios. The band spent four months travelling around Ireland and playing in pubs with old men who they freely admit were far better musicians. Then The Basement re-entered the studio. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Basement\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "Cosmicity, aka singer/songwriter/programmer Mark Nicholas, helped sustain and expand the underground Synthpop scene of the late 90's and early 00's. Today, one could successfully argue that he has finally become a true master of the genre. A new release (December 2014) called Humans May Safely Graze finds Mark at the top of his game. The songwriting has a weight and maturity that earlier material sometimes lacked, yet somehow every delicious synthpop flavor not only remains, but has blossomed. Mark's Erasure and Pet Shop Boys influences are still clear, but he's obviously been absorbing plenty of the new stuff too. Dubstep flourishes are hidden neatly in tiny pockets, and the more \"raw\" synthesizer sounds popular with bands like Chvrches and Class Acress have also seeped into his arsenal.\n\n\"Humans May Safely Graze\" was apparently over 4 years in the making. The quality and care taken is obvious, right down to the final mastering sheen applied at the famed Abbey Road Studio in London. (Yes, THAT Abbey Road.) Oh, sure, you'll find yourself feasting on the irresistible hooks on your first listen through this album, but you'll come back again and again for the emotional hook… secrets revealed and the truths identified. Indeed, it's not just a clever name: humans may safely graze.\n\nCosmicity on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/cosmicitynews\nCosmicity on Twitter http://www.twitter.com/cosmicitynews\n\nMore info:\n\n- Mark has a degree from the Universiy of Michigan in Music and Technology.\n\n- Mark is married to Detroit's DJ Ginger Snapp (The Labyrinth, Pr1mary Sounds, IPM Radio), who sometimes co-produces his albums.\n\n- Mark has done some cool stuff, like winning or placing in some songwriting competitions (John Lennon, ISC, Artist's Forum, etc.) getting his music on some shows and commercials (like the TV show \"Haunted\" starring Matthew Fox before he was on \"Lost\"!), and being on some cool compilations (Dodge Sounds of Detroit comp., the OMD Messages tribute album, etc.).\n\n- Mark sometimes creates harder-edged electronic music under his real name. He has so far released the albums Duchess 33 (2007) and Perversions (2008).\n\nFor more information, visit the Cosmicity Website here: http://www.cosmicity.com . <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cosmicity\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Karl had been writing songs and been in bands before but was inspired to start writing and record more music - this time inspired by Anne-Christel, the early 80s wave and postpunk music. \n\nAntipole makes elegant elecetronic/wave/postpunk music. Guitar-based tracks driven by a linear rythm, inspired by the beauty of nature as well as the everlasting presence of mixed feelings while living our lives. The music is like sketches, gust, a puff of wind. An instant expression, a journey into the intersection of the lightest light and the darkest dark. A melodic-hypnotic sphere, only reached by the ones who feel the multifaceted shades of life. So fragile, but yet so strong. \n\nAntipole has previously released two digital only 8-song EPs: “Panoply. Songs for AC” (2014) and “Getting Frequent Now” (2017). The former fully instrumental while the latter is featuring Paris Alexander. \n\nNovember 2017: The debut 14-song album “Northern Flux” out on Unknown Pleasures Records (UPR76) is featuring Paris Alexander and Eirene - both from Brighton, UK.\n\nNovember 2018: 13-song remix album Perspectives (digital release). Perspectives is a series of remixes by a wide selection of contemporary Darkwave and Coldwave artists. Each artist has put their unique mark and perspective on an Antipole track.

The band from Salt Lake City, Utah.  \"Loom formed in August of 2006 by former members of: the hi fi massacre, her candane, trojan, michigan, less than never, illborn, jetliner headache, part 2, the new transit direction, i am the ocean, harmon's heart, and farewell my enemy. We released our first EP, \"angler,\" on exigent records in march. We are currently working on touring our asses off and writing for a full length we plan to release next spring. also, this fall we're droppin' a split 10\" with Prize Country from Portland, Oregon whom we've been on tour with for the past few months. thank you to anyone who listens to our music, comes to shows, helps to promote us, buys or sports any of our merch, puts our banner or song on their page, or helps us in anyway. people are nothing without people.\"\n\n2.) A German IDM artist. He startet making electronic music in 2003, pretty much inspired by artists like Boards of Canada, Aphex Twin or Matmos. Beyond that he was always trying to get a more warm and natural sound by using a lot of natural sound samples. His first album \"Plastic Meadows\" came out in 2006 and was the result of these both sides of musical impression. His second album \"Coffee for the Kids\" had a different concept. The idea was to figure out a very childish way of making music. It came out self published at first, and then on acroplane records a year later. After this he changed his artist name to Kinskop . A first EP under that alias will come out soon.\n\nAll of Loom's Records where published under Creative Commons. \nSo, it's all for free... just check out http://www.myspace.com/fruitsofloom or http://www.myspace.com/kinskop for future releases.\n\n3.) An Australian electropop/mixed media crossover duo from Canberra, Australia. Formed in 2005 as a temporary support act for the Kevin Blechdom and Captain Ahab tours, Loom have mysteriously continued on. Their sound is characterised by oblique lyrics, copious sampling of global musics and field recordings, and cheezy beats. Live shows are notable for used of mixed media, preparing elaborate collages and paintings in the course of their shows, choreographed dancing, and the use of circuit-bent toy instruments. Their main website is reverbnation.com/loom, and they have the inevitable myspace page.\n\n4.) A Swedish Indie band founded in 1993 from Kalmar that released their first album 2006 named \"Not Even A Thousand Years Would Be Enough\". Inspired by bands such as The Cure, My Bloody Valentine and Joy Division.\n\n5.) An Estonian hard rock band. Their middle-finger attitude towards everything and everyone is synthesized into wall-crushing metal music that has been very successful and gathered hundreds of fans in Estonia and even Latvia. Since 2000 they have made a number of different concerts “moshable” and shared stages with such bands as No Big Silence, Pedigree, J.M.K.E., Forgotten Sunrise, Blind and their good colleagues from Latvia – F[EI]K. In 2001 Loom got promoted with an award “Best Young Band Of the Year” and a year later with \"Golden Record 2002\" award in the category of the best new-comer of 2001. All this progress has led to Loom’s first studio record, which is going to be released very soon.\n\n6.) a songwriter from Charlottesville Virginia named Craig Jones. Check out his music here. Craig was a member of the Boston band Sydra, which also featured members of Syrup USA and Victory at Sea. \n\n7.) Polish Progressive Rock Band \n\n8.) A Songwriter/Rock/Soul band from eastern Switzerland which has its roots in the 1990, when Manu Olowu (vocals, songwriting, guitar, calimba) frequently made music with Jo Eberhard (guitar, mandolin). Over the years they found further musicians, as Mario Söldi (drums, percussion, vocals) and Zachi (bass), who finally completed the band. In 2009, they published their first studio record \"Underneath\". \n\n9.) A singer-songwriter from Toronto, Canada named LOOM/Brooke Manning \"A singer-songwriter from which we can draw inspiration, sculpting images of lyrical dreams, fragile vocals, eyes closed, digging deep into soulful introspection.... like being graced by an earthbound angel providing musical joy. A warm, wistful spirit, demonstrating that minimal continues to be timeless and beautiful.\" -- Excerpt taken from CBC Radio. Songs on the LOOM Myspace page.\n\n10.)  Loom is a project by ex. Tangerine Dream members Johannes Schmoelling and Jerome Froese. The third member is Robert Waters.\nJohannes Schmoelling and Jerome Froese are well known to the public as longtime key members of electronic legend „Tangerine Dream“ and for their highly rated solo albums.\nRobert Waters already did a remix (in collaboration with Ulrich Schnauss) for the reissue of Johannes Schmoelling's solo album „White Out“ a few years ago and is one of Berlin's busiest producers.\nThe idea to collaborate already came up in late 2008 but due to a lot of issues it came to a standstill several times. But finally things have changed fundamentally a few months ago when Jerome asked Johannes for a co-op on his next solo album called „Far side of the face“ which turnend out to be a very fruitful experience. Loom will have their first concert on the 15th October 2011 at The Enck Theatre, near Eindhoven (Netherlands/Holland) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Loom\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "\"Ashbury Heights\" is a synthpop duo from Sweden consisting of the dynamic singer/producer/songwriter team of Anders Hagström and Tea F. Thimé.\n\nOriginally, the duo consisted of Anders Hagström and Yasmine Uhlin. However, she announced her surprise departure from the band in Hamburg at the last concert of the Out Of line festival tour 2008.\n\nAnders and Yazmine met in November 2005 and, upon discovering that they shared the same musical vision, decided to form a band. Their collaboration soon came to fruition with the release of a 9 track demo entitled \"Angora Overdrive\" after a very intensive month in the studio.\n\nThe second four track demo, \"Parliament of Rooks\", which was finished in February 2006, had a more refined sound compared to their first offering. They decided to send it to a few select labels because the reaction they got to the first demo was quite overwhelming. Having sent the demos on Monday, Ashbury Heights was contacted and contracted by German Out of Line records on Wednesday, only an hour after the label had received the CD. This probably makes Ashbury Heights one of the fastest signings in history. Several other labels expressed an interest in the band, but there was no bidding war as Out of Line moved so quickly.\n\nAlthough having signed the famous German act \"And One\" at about the same time as Ashbury Heights, which ate a lot of the labels' resources, Out of Line wasted no time. The legendary producer John Fryer was brought on board to produce the promotional single \"Cry Havoc\" in April 2006, something quite unheard of in the world of the electronic underground. Very few bands in the synth-genre get to release promo-CDs (if any), and certainly no other band in modern synth-history has released a promo-CD produced by a celebrity of the likes of Fryer.\n\nJohn Fryer would eventually mix their first album \"Three cheers for the newlydeads\". Released in october 2007, the debut album was recieved with overwhelming optimism from press and audience alike proving once and for all that Ashbury Heights truly is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nIn 2008 Ashbury Heights returned with the \"Morningstar in a Black Car\" EP, containing five new songs and four remixes. The EP received good reviews and helped keep up interest for the band. A video was made for the track \"Spiders\", a low budget affair which nevertheless managed to project some of the bands unique flair.\n\nAshbury Heights, with brand-new female vocalist Kari Berg, released their new album 'Take Cair paramour' on the 2nd of july 2010.  In 2010, following a long running dispute between Hagström and the record label Out Of Line the band disbanded. This dispute was settled in 2011, whereupon Hagstöm and Out of Line renewed their collaboration. However, it took until 2013 for Hagström to find a new singer. The new singer is Tea F. Thimé, the first female to co-write lyrics for Ashbury Heights.\n\n\nOfficial Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ashbury.heights\nOfficial Tumblr: http://ashburyheightsofficial.tumblr.com/\nOfficial Twitter: https://twitter.com/ashburyheights\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ashbury+Heights\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "Tearwave formed in the 2nd week of September 2006 in Lockport, NY (20 miles north of Buffalo,NY). \n\n  Doug White formed Tearwave with two long time friends Joe Villella and John Stephanski. Villella had been in several previous bands with White over the prior 15 years. His bass playing was always solid, melodic and as White stated: \"Joe always has that knack for playing just the right notes and the right amount of notes - not overdoing anything, but getting the right feel and right lines for each song in there - and that's not always the case with bass players. Joe was the perfect fit for the band.\" \n\n   Stephanski and White met in junior high school and had always held a mutual respect for each other as musicians. Stephanski had recorded several times in White's Watchmen Recording Studio over the years and White had always told Stephanski that his drumming was unique, interesting and like no other drummer that had come through the doors of his studio. White had always said to Stephanski \"...someday, we're going to do some recording together and it's going to be something special.\" White said of Stephanski: \"He would stop by the studio and ask about my latest band and he'd always ask if my latest band was the band that was going to make it.\" I always replied: \"No.\" White continues: \"John is the most open-minded person I've ever met when it comes to music and spotting sounds in music. He is a unique talent, unlike any drummer, musician or person I've ever met.\"\n\n  White had known Jennifer Manganiello's vocal talents from her gracing Watchmen Studios as well. Her red wine melody vocals filled the singing position, like no other singer could have done. White states: \"Her voice was perfect for what my plans were for this band. She has a strong voice, but she has a true angelic side to her voice that she had not used much in the past. I was all too happy to bring that pretty, sweet and hypnotic voice out of her in the studio - and I think we accomplished that !\"\n\n  Upon the death of Stephanski's long-time best friend and guitar player, Robert \"Bob\" Collopy - White called Stephanski and said: \"I'm forming a group John, this is the one that is going get signed and I'm going to really push to do something big with this project.\" Stephanski immediately said, yes and was the final piece to the puzzle. \n\nWhile they have been influenced by such classic shoegaze bands  as Slowdive, Lush and Ride.; American band Tearwave have attempted to meld their various influences into a unique sound fitting somewhere within the ethereal,  shoegaze and dream pop spectrum. \n\nTearwave signed to Projekt Records in November of 2009 after Shoegaze, Darkwave, Gothic, Ethereal and Dreampop message boards began to create a buzz all over the US, Europe, Mexico and Austrailia. \n\nTheir 2007 self titled debut was released in March of 2007 to critical acclaim. They began to get radio play in Chicago, Los Angeles, Tampa and the tri-state area, particularly, Philadelphia and on the college radio circuit. \n\nTheir video for their song \"Dream Bliss\" off of their first album was featured on a Hot Topic exclusive CD/DVD which featured other artists; Robert Smith of The Cure, Skinny Puppy, Type-O Negative and Lucuna Coil. This video was a Youtube smash hit and had over 96,000 when it was \"pulled\" from Youtube in April of 2009. \n\nThe first release was followed up by \"Different Shade of Beauty,\" which contained a massive 17 song offering at 77 minutes. It was an epic release and an instant classic according to some critics.\n\nTEARWAVES music consists of a great blend of Jenn Manganiello’s shimmering and dreamy vocals, supported by Doug White's ethereal and haunting guitars and keyboards, John Stephanski's insistent,  muscular and inventive drumming and percussive instruments and Joe Villella driving, thumping and melodic bass lines.\n\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tearwave\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Started as a small project, Behind the Scenes quickly grow and the first demo-tape was recorded.\n\nIn 1998 they recorded their first album, called \"FRAGMENT\" which entered directly into the german alternative charts (DAC) and stayed there for several weeks.\n\nTheir second album \"HOMELESS\" was released in 2000 by \"Bloodline\" and afterwards in the USA through Dancing Ferret Disks. And again they´ve entered the german alternativ charts with the Single-CD \"Human\". By the way there was an US-version of the \"HOMELESS\" containing 3 bonus tracks including the radio version of \"Human\" and two remixes, one done by Rogue of \"The Crüxshadows\".\n\nDuring that time they played a lot of concerts, e.g. the show at the Zillo-Open-Air in 1999, maybe the main independent festival in Europe during that time or as headliner on the 3rd Dark Convention at Zürich/Switzerland.\n\nUnfortunately their label \"Bloodline\" crashes down in 2002. Besides their guitarist Sven left the band of sanitary reasons. So Behind the Scenes had to look for an adequate substitute which took a long time. But then finally in 2005 they were successful and found Scholli (Ex-Secret Discovery, Syland, Assassin) as the new and long awaited member. So they start writing new songs and went in september 2005 in the studios to record their long awaited new album \"Pure\". Meanwhile the band also found a new record-company with the new founded label \"In-D Records\". Keep ears and eyes wide open for their third album \"Pure\" which will be released in 05/2006 in Europe (In-D Records / Soulfood) and on 06.06.2006 in USA/Canada (Dancing Ferret.\n\nThe style of Behind the Scenes is really unique, somewhere between rock, pop, gothic and of course, electronic elements.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Behind+The+Scenes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Schmidt has more of a dramatic arts background as a classically trained first soprano, immersive theater and musical theater performer. Formerly based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the two first began a similarly styled project with bandmate Miles Murphy called Prudence in 2015, which consisted of even more minimal and sad synth pop inspired by Depeche Mode. Prudence self-released the EP, Strange Memories, the following year with several tracks immediately featured on compilations by record labels such as Oraculo and Cold Beats. \n\nThe name changed to Milliken Chamber in 2017 after former bandmate Murphy moved to Ireland. The now duo released their next home-recorded debut EP, Lily of the Valley on label Starved Relations soon afterwards.

        "bio": "Night Moves is an American indie band from Minneapolis.\n\nFor such a patently American locale, the Twin Cities have lacked a remarkable group that evokes the American rock canon in a classic manner for a long time. Enter Night Moves. Formed in 2009 by guitarist and vocalist John Pelant, bassist Micky Alfano and multi-instrumentalist Mark Ritsema, Night Moves is a distinctly original concoction. Their honey-dipped sound seethes with a kind of down-home tenderness -- and like the best glittering music -- the arrangements are colossal in shape. Night Moves’ powerful debut Colored Emotions is this Minneapolis group’s first album.\nThe three core members of Night Moves first met at Southwest High School in Minneapolis. Following the tangential fits and starts typical of early music projects (including a detour to college and back), the ensemble took definite shape as Night Moves and is the crowning achievement to the long-standing collaboration between John Pelant and Mark Ritsema, who first met as freshman.\nPelant’s taste for Dylan, Blind Lemon Jefferson, et. al, would prove most propitious for their future work together in Night Moves. Ritsema describes himself as being into electronic music at the time - a Daft Punk fan - when he met budding folknik Pelant. Pelant throughout high school would write some solo material but hadn’t been keen on sharing. Whatever musical differences there were between them faded as the motivation to play music together persisted over the next years.\nIn 2009, with the group at last solidified with the addition of bassist Micky Alfano, Night Moves began the long, astounding odyssey that was recording their meticulous debut album Colored Emotions. Nearly two years in the making, the debut exudes the craft and professionalism of a seasoned band.  It was these painstakingly self-recorded tracks Night Moves prepared themselves that attracted interest from Domino, further developed with the appointment of studio guru Thom Monahan to take the album and set it free, so to speak.\nMonahan's easy-going nature was a relief for this perfectionist ensemble, who had already made something wholly precious in private.  According to Pelant, Monahan’s mountainous pedigree of producing terrific psychedelic pop and freak-folk outfits immediately eased their mind: Vetiver, Devendra Banhart, Beachwood Sparks... Night Moves were indeed in good company, and so they hauled down to Los Angeles to put the final touches on Colored Emotions.\nPelant's tone-perfect vocals on Colored Emotions serves Night Moves not just as its lyrical core but also its glittering adornment. With an extensive vocal range, his voice ventures where lone guitar solos cannot. Hence, there’s no cornball guitar hero antics in Night Moves. Instead, they carefully built their songs around strong acoustic and rhythmic grounds, the clarity of crystal-clear production, and Pelant’s deft howl. The reverb of hollow-body guitars, the bright wash of crash cymbals, the haze of harmonica and organ tremolo – this is the album’s bedrock and it shines like gold.\nAnd just as The Zombies’ classic Odyssey and Oracle has surprising melodic twists and shape-shifting choruses but never beats you over the head with them, the epic arrangements throughout Colored Emotions are sophisticated but not overbearing. Standouts “Headlights” and “Country Queen” are both perfect examples: seamless segues and hook-laden bridges defy conventional song structures, yet remain altogether memorable.\nThe songs of Night Moves conjure a spiritual energy only twenty-somethings dislodged by adversity and isolation could produce. An album like Colored Emotions seems intent to turn inward to create a joyous universe within its own boundaries. Certainly, the group's musical abilities are innate without ever being too self-conscious about it.  It’s as if Colored Emotions came second nature to them and the arrival of the rest of us took them by surprise.\n\n-- by Anthony Atlas <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Night+Moves\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The original line up was the three brothers: Jason Perry (Vocals), Adam Perry (Drums) and Giles Perry (Keyboard), with two friends Mark Chapman (Guitar) and Steve Swindon (Bass). Swindon quit the band in 1997 and was replaced by Daniel P. Carter.\n\nAfter changing their name from 'Grand Designs' and abandoning their early progressive-inspired sound for a more punky feel, they released their début album \"How Ace Are Buildings\" in 1997. \n\nThe second album; \"A vs. Monkey Kong\", followed in 1999. Monkey Kong was a more poppy record than How Ace Are Buildings and the band toured the world, played festivals and enjoyed a small degree of success worldwide, especially in Germany.  \nHi-Fi Serious was their third album, released in 2002. It was preceded by their biggest single to date, \"Nothing\", which saw the band reach the UK top ten for the first time, eventually hitting number 9. Starbucks was also a top 20 hit, named after the coffee chain. \n\nThe tour following Hi-Fi Serious saw the band playing their largest venues to date, headlining the 5000 capacity Brixton Academy as part of the Inner-City Sumo Tour. 'A' finally released their fourth album on June 27th 2005, entitled \"Teen Dance Ordinance\". The album had been recorded 2 years earlier, but due to Jason Perry's illness and record company squabbles its release was heavily delayed, by which time the group's following appears to be a mere cult once again. In 2006, Warner dropped 'A' from their record label, citing poor sales.\n\n'A' then went on hiatus from 2006-2008, but have now returned, playing a few shows supporting The Wildhearts. They will be writing new material and hope to release an album in 2009. With this new era for the band the lineup has changed with bassist Daniel P. Carter not returning to the band and has been replaced by John Mitchell of It Bites.\n\nJapanese visual rock band : \nconsisting of Shin-ichi on vocals, Seiya on bass, U-SUKE and MORI on guitar, and Tōki on drums. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/A\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Choosing toy instruments and live drums out of necessity, CCIS began to experiment with a series of analog recording devices. The instruments gave way to crude drum machines and 'Frankenstein' type home-made instruments. \n\nChampioned by local radio station WXPN DJ Lee Paris they recorded the single \"Cakes in the Home\" (with the B-side containing \"Kitchen Motors\" and \"Mechanical Breakdown\") for his Go Go label (GO GO R001). This was followed by \"Signals from Pier Thirteen\" (Press Records P 2001) in 1981 produced by John Wicks at Third Story Recordings. This 12\" EP contained the songs 'Cardboard Lamb' and 'Flying Turns' which are two of the bands most recognizable tracks. This record has been regarded as influential to the techno industrial genres and was an early inception of what is now known as the 'electro' sound. This record is still highly sought-after by collectors and fans today.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Crash+Course+in+Science\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Save all your speculation about what is and what isn't hardcore for the internet, because Syracuse, New York's THE PROMISE are here to show you just what hardcore is, and with a vengeance.\n\nCulled from some of the most classic and respected Straight Edge bands of the 1990s (Another Victim, One King Down, Conviction), THE PROMISE began in 2001 under the moniker of True Love, a project intending to bring five old friends together to show the world that time had yet to wear them down or break their will. Their determination paid off as word spread quickly of the juggernaut-to-be being birthed in the basements and streets of upstate New York. With a release of the \"My True Love\" CD/7\" on Boston's Deathwish Inc., it has proven to be another in a series of signals that THE PROMISE will not be stopped in their ongoing crusade to raise a middle finger to complacency and apathy in hardcore, and accord due respect to the beliefs and ideals of the Straight Edge movement.\n\nIn addition to flooring audiences in their hometown, THE PROMISE has designs on spreading their hardcore reality to kids all over the U.S. and the world in the foreseeable future. Now a proud addition to the stable of California's venerated Indecision Records, THE PROMISE endeavor to put forth one of the most important hardcore records in years this summer, which they are currently hard at work in constructing. Success for THE PROMISE goes far beyond monetary status and acceptance in a world of impostors and trends. The ability to reproduce the courage that has built the foundation of their lives and to ressurect the spirit of true, tempered hardcore. This is THE PROMISE, this is their one true love.\n\nThe Promise hardcore 2001-2005\n\n3) The Promise were a melodic rock and from Aberdeen, Scotland. Originally know as Tour De Force in the late eighties, the band had broken up, but were persuaded to reform with the offer of a record deal from Now and Then Records. They recorded two albums, an eponymous effort in 1995 and Human Fire in 1999. They disbanded in 2002 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Promise\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
